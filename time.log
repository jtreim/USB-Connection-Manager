                        Looking up how to remotely logon to windows machine, cause steam link
                        needs that.

                        Allow it to create a restricted Windows user on the first time?

                        I'd have to give it admin privileges for at least the first time though.
                        Still need to figure out how to give an application permission to turn on
                        the machine.

                        I might not be able to remote desktop with my version of windows 10

                        My current thought is to create a restricted Windows user (somehow) that can only
                        allow steam link connections. Then if I can detect a wake-up signal from the
                        registered pi app, and recognize that it came from this app, the windows machine
                        automatically logs in to that restricted account. Of course, automating this setup
                        on both machines might be a bit of a pain.
                        The only other thing for all of this is to make a script that does all this when
                        the right USB connection is made.
